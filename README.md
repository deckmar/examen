### About ###
Web-app that helps when applying for examen. It finds all possible arrangements of courses by following constraints for all examens of interest. 

Example of a constraint for an examen is "at least 60hp in Mathematics" or "at least 30hp on AV level in Economy".

### When to use this? ###
This app is useful when reading many self-selected courses, and its becoming time to divide these courses between - for example - a bachelor-degree "Kandidatexamen i Industriell Ekonomi" and a master-degree "Civilingenj√∂r i Industriell Ekonomi", following their constraints and without re-using any courses.


### Dependencies for development ###

NPM, Gulp, TypeScript (recommending IDE "Atom" and plugin "atom-typescript")
